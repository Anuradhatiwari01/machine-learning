# Machine Learning – Learning Repository

## What this repository is about
This repository is a learning space where I practice and understand
basic concepts of machine learning step by step.

The focus is on learning fundamentals through small examples and experiments.

## Why I created this
I wanted to build a strong foundation in machine learning concepts
before applying them to larger projects.

This repository helps me organize my learning and practice ideas
as I study machine learning academically.

## My learning
- Understanding data before modeling
- Basic concepts like features and labels
- Simple machine learning models
- How model output is interpreted
- Common mistakes beginners make in ML

## Repository structure
- Each folder focuses on a specific learning topic
- Code and notebooks are kept simple and readable

## Tech used
- Python
- Basic data handling libraries

## Current status
This is an ongoing learning repository.
Content is added gradually as I study new topics.

## What I learned so far
- Importance of clean and structured data
- Difference between training and testing data
- Why understanding data matters more than models
